    ### Making music with money
    
    **Watching your portfolio is not the peak. Hear how your portfolio is doing.**
    
    Transform financial data into beautiful music. Turn price movements into melodies, 
    volatility into rhythms, and market trends into harmonies.

        ### How It Works
        This is a fun proof of concept that demonstrates the relationship between financial data and music:
        
        - **Simple Mapping**: Noisy price data is normalized to harmonic scales
        - **Real-time Conversion**: Stock movements become musical notes
        - **Instant Composition**: Generate unique melodies from any ticker
        
        ### Future Possibilities
        For more complex implementations, we could explore:
        - **Chord Progressions**: Set specific chord sequences
        - **Volume as Arpeggiation Range**: Use trading volume to control note range
        - **Price Volatility as Arpeggiation Density**: Higher volatility = more complex patterns
        - **Multi-instrument Arrangements**: Different instruments for different data points
        - **Tempo Mapping**: Use market speed to control musical tempo
